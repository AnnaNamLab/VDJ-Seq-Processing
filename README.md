VDJ (Variable, Diversity, and Joining) processing is a key mechanism in the generation of diverse B cell receptors (BCRs), which are essential for the adaptive immune response. The BCR is an antibody anchored on the surface of B cells, recognizing specific antigens through highly variable regions, generated during B cell development. The generation of a diverse B cell receptor (BCR) repertoire is fundamental to the immune system's ability to recognize and respond to a vast array of pathogens. This repository contains all codes related to generating BCR/TCR sequencing, and all downstream analysis.
